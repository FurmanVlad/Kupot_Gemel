<p id="description">This project focuses on the development of a system for the personal management of pension portfolios and provident funds. The system is designed for individuals who want to manage their pension savings in an efficient and personalized manner. It allows users to track provident fund data in real time providing an accurate breakdown of the investment compositions within the funds.

Unlike existing tools this system stands out by offering personalized recommendations through automatic data analysis. It includes a user preferences questionnaire to tailor the suggestions enhancing the ability of users to make informed financial decisions and adapt their funds to their personal needs.

Additionally the system features a comprehensive inquiry module that allows users to open track and review technical support inquiries. The technical support team can manage these requests update their status and escalate complex issues to the system administrator as needed ensuring quick and efficient resolution of any problems that may arise.</p>
